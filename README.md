# MapReduce Implementation Examples

This repository contains implementations of the MapReduce distributed computing framework in multiple programming languages. Each implementation is based on the principles outlined in Google's [MapReduce paper](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf).

## Features

- **Distributed Processing**: Execute computations across multiple machines
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handles node failures and network interruptions
- **Scalability**: Easily scale with additional worker nodes
- **Custom Functions**: Define custom map and reduce operations
- **Built-in Examples**: Includes word count and other common MapReduce tasks

## Available Implementations

### [Golang Implementation](./golang)

A Go-based MapReduce framework featuring:

- Clean and straightforward implementation
- Plugin system for custom MapReduce tasks
- Efficient worker coordination
- Example WordCount implementation

### [Rust Implementation](./rust)

A high-performance Rust implementation offering:

- High concurrency with Rust's safety guarantees
- Async runtime for efficient I/O
- Strong type system and memory safety
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Architecture

The system follows a coordinator-worker architecture:

### Coordinator

- Manages task distribution
- Handles worker coordination
- Tracks job progress
- Manages fault tolerance

### Workers

- Execute map and reduce tasks
- Handle data processing
- Communicate with coordinator
- Manage intermediate results
